          Hello! Iâ€™m Desiree, a great web development enthusiast. My journey into coding started in high school when I discovered the world of web development and was immediately passionate. After completing an intensive course, I have acquired a solid base of skills which I apply with enthusiasm to practical and dynamic projects.

          I focus on the user experience, aiming to create simple, intuitive and functional interfaces. Each project is an opportunity to combine passion and creativity, with the aim of creating effective and engaging solutions.
